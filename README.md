# Student Feedback Analysis â€” Campus Events

This project uses data science techniques to turn student feedback into actionable insights.  
By analyzing ratings and comments from campus events (tech fests, workshops, cultural programs), we uncover satisfaction trends and suggest improvements for organizers.

##  Project Overview
- Data Source: Student feedback (Google Forms CSV export)  
- Tools: Jupyter note book, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, TextBlob/VADER  
- Methods: Data cleaning, sentiment analysis, rating distribution analysis, and visualization  

##  What Youâ€™ll Learn
- Clean and prepare survey data with pandas  
- Perform sentiment analysis on student comments  
- Visualize results with charts, histograms, and word clouds  
- Generate actionable recommendations for improving campus events  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Overall satisfaction scoring (1â€“10 scale)  
- Top strengths and improvement areas identified automatically  
- Visuals: bar charts, pie charts, word clouds  
- Sentiment analysis (positive/neutral/negative distribution)  

## ðŸ“Œ Example Insights
- Students rate subject knowledge highly (avg ~7.5/10).  
- Support for students going above-and-beyond needs improvement (~5.6/10).  
- Recommendation scores suggest moderate interest, highlighting areas to improve engagement.  

## âœ… Final Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab notebook with analysis  
- Mini-report (charts + insights + recommendations)  
- Actionable suggestions for event organizers
